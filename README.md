# Cosmic Byte CB-GK-37 Reverse Engineered Led Protocol

Reverse engineering the LED protocol for the Cosmic Byte CB-GK-37 keyboard. This repository contains code written primarily in Rust and Python for interfacing with and controlling the keyboard's LED functionalities.

## Language Composition

- **Rust (82.5%)**: The majority of the implementation is done in Rust, ensuring performance and safety in low-level interfacing with the hardware.
- **Python (17.5%)**: Python is used for scripting, testing, or high-level communication with the hardware.

## Repository Overview

This repository is dedicated to reverse-engineering the LED protocol of the Cosmic Byte CB-GK-37 keyboard. The work done here can enable the development of custom software to control the keyboard's lighting effects and patterns.

### Features

- Reverse-engineered LED protocol for the CB-GK-37 keyboard.
- Code to interact with the keyboard's lighting system.
- Modular design for easy extension and integration.
